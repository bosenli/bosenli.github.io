Reflecting on this spring semester of 2025 at NYU as a Cyber Fellow, it’s been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into code, identify vulnerabilities, test exploits, and apply fixes. Although it was stressful at times, the sense of accomplishment after resolving issues and earning great scores made it all worth it.

I wish I could post all the reports written throughout the semester—they’re quite extensive! But feel free to explore them by clicking into each assignment’s .txt files on GitHub.

### Assignment 1: Beware of Geeks Bearing Gift Cards
In this assignment, I had to brush up on C programming to understand the codebase and uncover memory-related issues. It was essential to recognize and fix vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. I also applied fuzzing techniques to test the program using seeded inputs, which helped expose unexpected behaviors.

### Assignment 2: When a Wreck Reaches the World Wide Web
This assignment focused on web security. I successfully rendered a Python Django web application and conducted various types of vulnerability assessments. It was exciting to explore attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, and learn how to mitigate them.

### Assignemnt 3, In this module, I worked with Docker to containerize applications and used Kubernetes to manage deployments. Watching the pods spin up and scale was truly an exciting and hands-on learning experience.
