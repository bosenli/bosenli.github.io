ðŸŒŸ I write about cybersecurity, cloud, and software development.  
This blog shares what I learn, build, and explore.

### A Little About me:
I was born knowing nothing and spent much of my early life unsure of my direction. It wasnâ€™t until my late 20s that I realized how profoundly technological advancements can transform livesâ€”making everything more productive and efficient. That realization sparked my excitement for the field. Staying curious, positive, and passionate about technology and innovation continues to drive me to keep learning and moving forward.

In my free time, I enjoy diving into topics like penetration testing, offensive security, and reverse engineering.

### Share something about learning skills I realized when I grown up and made my learning skills into a FRAMEWORK of mine I would like to share:

Learn by:

- Solving real problem scenario
- Understanding the road map (Aka Architecture)
- Try asking youself **WHY** this way (first principle)
- Doing, make **A LOT OF** mistakes and correct them
- Sharing and repeating
- Comparing similar but different things
- Summary and relection by closing your eye and write it down!
- from others

To memorize better:

- Relate to yourself and make acronym

To keep myself learning continuesly:

- Set goal and complete it
- Be focus
- Ask yourself end of day "What have I accomplished today?"

(if you have better idea on how to learn efficiently, contact me ppmc168@gmail.com , lets have some coffee and ice cream! My Treat! ðŸ˜Š )
