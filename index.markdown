ðŸŒŸ I write about cybersecurity, cloud, and software development.  
This blog shares what I learn, build, and explore.

### A Little About me:
I was born knowing nothing and did not know what to do in my early life. I only figured that out after late 20s, realizing technology advancement can change my life and people's every life so dramatically into a more productive and efficient way. It start making me excited about this field. By staying curious, postive and be passionate about technology and innovation always motivates me to keep learning and moving forward!

During my break time, I like to learn more about pen testing, offsec, and reverse engineering.

### Share something about learning skills I realized when I grown up and made my learning skills into a FRAMEWORK of mine I would like to share:

Learn by:

- Solving real problem scenario
- Understanding the road map (Aka Architecture)
- Try asking youself **WHY** this way (first principle)
- Doing, make **A LOT OF** mistakes and correct them
- Sharing and repeating
- Comparing similar but different things
- Summary and relection by closing your eye and write it down!
- from others

To memorize better:

- Relate to yourself and make acronym

To keep myself learning continuesly:

- Set goal and complete it
- Be focus
- Ask yourself end of day "What have I accomplished today?"

(if you have better idea on how to learn efficiently, contact me ppmc168@gmail.com , lets have some coffee and ice cream! My Treat! ðŸ˜Š )
